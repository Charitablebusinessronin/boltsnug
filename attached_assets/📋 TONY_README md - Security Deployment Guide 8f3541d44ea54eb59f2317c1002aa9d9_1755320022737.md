# üõ°Ô∏è TONY STARK - POST-REPLIT MIGRATION SECURITY GUIDE

**Mission:** Secure SNUGS & KISSES after Bolt‚ÜíReplit migration

**Status:** Migration complete, addressing Zoho authentication issues

**Current Problem:** Can't log into Zoho - authentication reverted/disabled

---

## üéØ **CURRENT SITUATION ASSESSMENT**

### **‚úÖ REPLIT MIGRATION COMPLETED**

- **Platform**: Successfully migrated from Bolt to Replit
- **Environment**: Node.js 20.19.3 with npm/yarn/pnpm/bun support
- **Port**: Application running on port 5000
- **Development Mode**: Auth bypass implemented for development testing
- **Status**: App loads properly without external dependencies

### **üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

1. **Zoho Authentication Blocked**: Cannot log into Zoho - authentication reverted/disabled
2. **Unauthorized Changes**: AI made changes that weren't requested
3. **Branch Status Unknown**: Need to determine current git branch state
4. **Production Readiness**: Security validation needed before deployment

---

## üîí **IMMEDIATE SECURITY PRIORITIES**

### **CRITICAL PRIORITY 1: Assess Current State (15 minutes)**

**Timeline:** Immediate

```bash
# Check current branch and changes
git branch
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Verify what's running
ps aux | grep node
netstat -tulpn | grep 5000
```

### **CRITICAL PRIORITY 2: Zoho Authentication Recovery (60 minutes)**

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- Determine why Zoho authentication was disabled/reverted
- Check if Catalyst credentials were affected during migration
- Verify OAuth configurations survived migration
- Test authentication endpoints

### **CRITICAL PRIORITY 3: Migration Security Validation (45 minutes)**

**Replit Environment Security:**

- Validate secrets management in Replit environment
- Confirm environment variables properly configured
- Test production deployment readiness
- Ensure HIPAA compliance maintained

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **REPLIT-SPECIFIC SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Environment Security**

```bash
# Replit environment validation
echo $REPL_SLUG
echo $REPL_OWNER
env | grep -i secret
env | grep -i zoho

# Check .replit configuration
cat .replit
ls -la .env*
```

### **Network Security**

- **Port 5000**: Confirm secure exposure configuration
- **Replit Domains**: Validate CORS settings for Replit URLs
- **SSL/TLS**: Ensure encryption maintained in Replit environment

### **Development vs Production Security**

- **Dev Bypass**: Current auth bypass only for development
- **Production Config**: Separate secure configuration needed
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Security checks before going live

---

## üìä **RECOVERY ACTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: State Assessment (15 minutes)**

1. **Git Status Review**
    - Determine current branch
    - Identify unauthorized changes
    - Plan rollback if necessary
2. **Environment Audit**
    - Check Replit configuration
    - Validate environment variables
    - Test current functionality

### **Phase 2: Zoho Authentication Recovery (60 minutes)**

1. **Catalyst Console Check**
    - Verify project status in Zoho Catalyst
    - Check authentication settings
    - Restore disabled configurations
2. **OAuth Configuration**
    - Update Replit domains in OAuth settings
    - Test authentication flow
    - Validate redirect URIs

### **Phase 3: Security Hardening (45 minutes)**

1. **Replit Security Setup**
    - Configure secure secrets management
    - Validate network exposure
    - Test HIPAA compliance features
2. **Deployment Preparation**
    - Security scan in Replit environment
    - Production configuration validation
    - Go-live readiness assessment

---

## üö® **ESCALATION PROTOCOLS**

### **Immediate Escalation Triggers**

- Zoho authentication cannot be restored within 1 hour
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in migration
- HIPAA compliance compromised
- Production deployment timeline at risk

### **Status Reporting**

- **15 minutes**: Initial state assessment complete
- **1 hour**: Zoho authentication status update
- **2 hours**: Full security validation report

---

**TONY - Focus on understanding what changed during migration, fix Zoho auth, and ensure we haven't compromised security. Document everything clearly.** üéØ
